  <h3>Seeding</h3>
  <p>
    In molecular biology, "seeding" refers to placing cells into a culture vessel (like a petri dish, flask, or well plate) to initiate cell culture. This fundamental process involves introducing a concentrated cell suspension and diluting it into a culture medium, allowing the cells to attach, proliferate, and form a uniform layer for experiments like drug testing or genetic research. The process is also called "plating" and is crucial for experiments that require a consistent and reproducible cell population.

  <h3>Transfect</h3>
  <p>
   Transfection is a molecular biology technique used to introduce foreign nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, into eukaryotic cells to modify their genetic makeup or function. This process uses chemical, physical, or biological (viral) methods to deliver the genetic material into the cell, allowing researchers to study gene function, create cell models, or explore potential therapeutic applications like gene therapy.

  <h3>Western Blot</h3>
  <p>
    A western blot is a molecular biology technique used to detect and quantify specific proteins in a complex mixture by separating them by size using gel electrophoresis, transferring them to a membrane, and then using antibodies to identify the target protein. The final detection step typically involves a labeled antibody that generates a signal (like a colored or luminescent band) corresponding to the protein's size, allowing researchers to confirm the protein's presence, size, and relative abundance.
